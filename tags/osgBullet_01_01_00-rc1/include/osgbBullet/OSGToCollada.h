    // COPY to OSGToCollada, which it can alter, then DISCARD that copy. The scene
    // graph is not guaranteed to be viable after an OSGToCollada conversion.

    // shape is created (which is used to create the rigid body that is written to
    // the Collada file):
    //   overall  nodeName   Results
    //    true     empty     A single collision shape is created based on the bounding volume of the entire 'sg' scene graph.
    //    true    non-empty  'sg' is searched until a node with name 'nodeName' is found, then a single collision shape is created based on the bounding volume of the subgraph rooted at that node.
    //    false    empty     Collision shapes are created for all Geodes in 'sg' and assembled into a compound collision shape.
    //    false   non-empty  'sg' is searched until a node with name 'nodeName' is found, then collision shapes are created for all Geodes below that node and assembled into a compound collision shape.
