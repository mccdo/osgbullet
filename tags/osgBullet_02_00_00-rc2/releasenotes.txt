osgBullet v2.00.00 Release Notes

v2.00.00 is not backwards-compatible with osgBullet v1.xx. osgBullet-based
applications and projects will need to port their code to the new version.
Changes from v1.01.00 to v2.00.00 include the following:

* The osgbBullet library has been replaced with two libraries: osgbCollision and
osgbDynamics. Your project will need to link with the new libraries. The
v2.00.00 contains an analogous change in the namespaces and header file
directory structure.

  * By linking with osgbCollision, your osgBullet application can use Bullet for
  collision detection without a dependency on libBulletDynamics. The new
  collision example program demonstrates this usage.

* The OSGToCollada class has been replaced by new rigid body creation
convenience routines. See the osgbDynamics/RigidBody.h header file. Nearly all
of the examples and tests use the new interface.

A new library, osgbInteraction, has been added to allow user interaction with
the physics simulation. The library contains the following classes:

  * The HandNode class features a fully articulated hand model that can be
  driven by a data glove or keyboard. Support for the P5 data glove is provided.

  * The DragHandler allows the user to drag rigid bodies using the mouse.

  * The LaunchHandler allows the user to fire objects into the scene.

  * The SaveRestoreHandler allows the user to capture the physics simulation at
  a particular point in time, then restore back to the capture point.

* New examples demonstrate hinge and slider constraints.

* The MotionState class now exposes routines to convert between Bullet collision
object and OSG coordinates while correctly accounting for differences due to
center of mass and scaling.

* A new example, saverestore, demonstrates saving current physics state and
restoring from file.

* Many classes are now documented using Doxygen.
