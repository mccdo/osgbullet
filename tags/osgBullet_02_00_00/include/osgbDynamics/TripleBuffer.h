/** \class TripleBuffer TripleBuffer.h <osgbDynamics/TripleBuffer.h>
\brief A triple buffer mechanism to support physics and rendering in separate threads.

This class allows the read
thread to always access the latest complete set of updated
data without blocking, and allows the write thread to always 
switch to an available buffer to write the next set of data
without blocking.

Multiple heterogeneous chunks of data may be stored in buffers
by using reserve() to specify a data size and retrieve back the
unsigned int index into the TripleBuffer storage. This index is a count of
least-resolvable machine units (usually bytes).

In a typical usage case, each MotionState has a matrix
stored in the triple buffer object. The physics sim thread wraps the
stepSimulation call with beginWrite() and endWrite(). When Bullet sets the
world transform of the collision objects, MotionState intercepts the
transforms and stores them in the current write buffer. Concurrently,
during the scene graph update phase, the rendering thread calls beginRead(),
uses the data to update matrices in the scene graph, then calls endRead().

    they contain \c size bytes of contiguous memory. Because reallocation
    can be expensive, applications should avoid repeated resize() calls.

    Applications should call reserve() whenever they want to access a chunk of
    data by two threads. For example, MotionState calls reserve() to allocate
    space for a btTransform. The \c size parameter is set to sizeof(btTransform).
    The return value is used by the Physics thread to write the transform, and
    used by the MotionState to update the matrix of the OSG Transform node it manages.

    \param size The size of memory to reserve. If the currently allocated
        mrmory plus \c size exceeds the total storage specified with resize(),
        this function reallocates the TripleBuffer storage to accomodate the request.
