/** \class ComputeShapeVisitor ComputeShapeVisitor.h <osgbCollision/ComputeShapeVisitor.h>
\brief A NodeVisitor that creates Bullet collision shapes for each Geode and assembles them
into a single btCompoundShape.

This visitor is designed to work in conjuction with the
\link rigidbody rigid body creation utilities \endlink and is invoked indirectly from
osgbDynamics::createRigidBody() via btCompoundShapeFromOSGGeodes().

To correctly support center of mass and scaling, the source scene graph should
be temporarily multiparented to a MatrixTransform containing the concatenation of
the negative center of mass translation and the scale matrix. See the implementation
of osgbDynamics::createRigidBody(), which does this correctly.

Bullet's box, sphere, and cylinder shapes are always at the origin, so this visitor
creates them as child shapes of a btCompoundShape (which supports a btTransform per child).
Triangle mesh, convex tri mesh, and convex hull are generated from transformed geometric
data and don't require this additional level of indirection.

<b>Work To Be Done</b>

The created collision shape is a btCompoundShape. However, the compound shape
is entirely flat (collision shapes created from each Geode are added directly as
children to the btCompoundShape). Bullet might benefit from a more hierarchical
arrangement. For example, when the visitor encounters a Group during traversal,
it could add a btCompoundShape child, which becomes the new parent for any Geodes
under that Group. We should investigate this before proceeding with this work.

A collision shape per Geode is not necessarily the most accurate way to represent
all OSG scene graphs. Perhaps a collision shape per Geometry, or per PrimitiveSet,
or some combination of all three, would be best. For now, only per-Geode is supported.
