/** \class LaunchHandler LaunchHandler.h <osgbInteraction\LaunchHandler.h>
\brief An event handler to support throwing objects into a dynamics simulation.

This class allows users to launch btRigidBody objects into the scene using
shift-leftmouse.

By default, the launched object is a sphere with radius 1.0 at a velocity of 10.0
units/sec. However, the application can specify an arbitrary model to launch, and
also change the initial velocity.

LaunchHandler uses multiparenting so that only one incarnation of the launch model
is present in the scene graph, regardless of how many objects the user has launched.
LaunchHandler also shares the same btCollisionShape between all launched objects.

LaunchHandler is compatible with SaveRestoreHandler, so that hitting the Delete key
to trigger a SaveRestoreHandler::reset() will remove all launched rigid bodies. */
