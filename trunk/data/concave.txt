# Comments:
#
#         A blank line is considered a comment (it's ignored).
# #       A pound sign by itself is a comment.
# # text  A pount sign followed by a space followed by text is a comment.

# World setup.
#
# Up: x y z      Specifies the up vector. Default is 0 0 1. (Place
#                this command before the "Model:" command, as the
#                model is translated by the up vector.)
# GroundPlane: {1|0}
#                Create a ground plane. Default is 1 (true)
# HandNode: pos att length right
#                HandNode initial parameters. "length" is a float.
#                "right" is {1|0}, default is 1 (right).
# Model: name    Loads the named file. Does not create a rigid body,
#                but includes it in future node searches.

# Rigid body creation control parameters.
#
# Node: name     Specifies a node name to search for. Can be turned
#                into a rigid body with "Body:", or used as an
#                attachment point for "AttachBody:".
# MatchAllNodes: {1|0}
#                When "Body:" and "AttachBody:" search for a named node,
#                convert / attach to all node matches. Default: 0 (false);
#                only the first match is converted / attached to.
# Overall: {1|0} Specifies the "overall" paramter to OSGToCollada.
#                Default is 1 (truw).
# Mass: m        Specifies the mass of future rigid bodies. Default
#                is 1.0.
# CollisionFilter: group with
#                Specifies collision filters. Default is 0 0.
# Shape: s       Specifies a collision shape for future rigid bodies.
#                "s" is a BroadphaseNativeTypes cast as an int.
#                Default: 0  BOX_SHAPE_PROXYTYPE
#                         3  CONVEX_TRIANGLEMESH_SHAPE_PROXYTYPE
#                         4  CONVEX_HULL_SHAPE_PROXYTYPE
#                         8  SPHERE_SHAPE_PROXYTYPE
#                         13 CYLINDER_SHAPE_PROXYTYPE
#                         21 TRIANGLE_MESH_SHAPE_PROXYTYPE

# Creating rigid bodies.
#
# Body:          Creates a rigid body from the subgraph rooted at "Node:".
# AttachBody: file
#                Loads the named file, attaches it to "Node:", and creates
#                a rigid body from the loaded data.

# Constraint creation.
#
# Hinge: nodeNameA nodeNameB pivotA pivotB axisA axisB
#                Creates a hinge constraint between two named nodes.
# Slider: nodeNameA nodeNameB axis low high useA
#                Creates a slider constraint between two named nodes.
