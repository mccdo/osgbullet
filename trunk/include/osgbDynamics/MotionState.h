/** \class MotionState MotionState.h <osgbDynamics/MotionState.h>
\brief A btMotionState that works with OSG Transforms.

A btMotionState that allows Bullet to set the ransformation
of an OSG subgraph corresponding to a rigid body.

This class can interface with an osg::MatrixTransform
or an osgwTools::AbsoluteModelTransform.

In typical usage, your application uses the \ref rigidbody routines to create
a rigid body, which implicitly creates a MotionState. However, if your application
doesn't use the \ref rigidbody routines, you will need to explicitly create
a MotionState in order to keep your visual and physical representations in sync.

To attache a MotionState to your OSG subgraph:
\li Call setTransform() and pass in the root node of your subgraph.
   The node must be an osg::MatrixTransform or an osgwTools::AbsoluteModelTransform.
\li Call setParentTransform() to specify the initial transformation
   for the subgraph (usually the OSG local to world matrix from the
   subgraph parent's NodePath).
\li Call setCenterOfMass() to specify the xyz point corresponding
   to the origin of the Bullet collision shape used by the rigid body.
