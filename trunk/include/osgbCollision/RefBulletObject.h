/** \class RefBulletObject RefBulletObject.h <osgbCollision/RefBulletObject.h>
\brief A template class for maintaining reference-counted Bullet objects.

This class overlays OSG's reference-counted memory system on top of Bullet objects.
Use it to store a reference to a Bullet object in a scene graph Node's UserData pointer,
for example, or in any OSG interactions that require a reference-counted entity.

This class replaces RefCollisionShape, RefCollisionObject, and RefRigidBody.

This class derives from Referenced. When its reference count reaches zero, the
base class invokes the destructor. By default, RefBulletObject doesn't delete the
managed object. Change the default behavior with the \c doDelete constuctor
parameter.

If you change the default behavior so that this class deletes the managed object,
then calling setBulletObject() while an object is already managed will cause that
object to be deleted.
