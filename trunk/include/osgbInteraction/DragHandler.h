/** \class DragHandler DragHandler.h <osgbInteraction\DragHandler.h>
\brief An event handler for selecting and dragging rigid bodies.

To use this event handler, simply create an instance of it and add it to your
osgViewer::Viewer.

During a ctrl-leftmouse click, DragHandler does an intersection test with
the \c scene. The test succeeds if the picked object has a Node in its NodePath
containing a RefRigidBody stored in the Node's UserData. DragHandler then adds
the picked btRigidBody to a new btPoint2PointConstraint and adds it to the
dynamics world. DragHandler also computes a drag plane, orthogonal to the view
direction and containing the intersection point.

On subsequent ctrl-leftmouse drag events, DragHandler back-transform the mouse
position to create a world space ray, and intersects it with the DragPlane.
DragHandler then sets this intersection point in the constraint.

On a leftmouse release event, DragHandler removes the constraint and deletes it.
