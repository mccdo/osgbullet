#summary Plans for upcoming osgBullet releases

<wiki:toc />

= v2.0 =

*Release date: Expected late 2011

*Status:* Not yet started.

This non-backwards compatible release will remove all portions of osgBullet that depend on the Bullet !ColladaConverter library. It will also split the existing osgbBullet library into two libraries, osgbCollision and osgbDynamics, so that osgBullet can be used for collision detection without a dependency on libBulletDynamics.

= v1.1 =

*Released 11 Sept 2010

This is the first release that attempts to be compatible with Bullet v2.76. The portions of osgBullet that require the Bullet !ColladaConverter library (removed in v2.76) will not function. You must use Bullet v2.74 or v2.75 to use osgBullet with !ColladaConverter.
