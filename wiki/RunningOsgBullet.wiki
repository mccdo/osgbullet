#summary Configuring a system to run an osgBullet-based application

= Set PATH =

Set your PATH environment variable so that the operating ststem can find the osgBullet binary files. This is the install location, such as /usr/local/bin or C:\Program Files\osgBullet\bin.

= Set OSG_FILE_PATH =

Set your OSG_FILE_PATH environment variable so that OSG and osgBullet can find the osgBullet "data" directory. The path will depend on the location of your osgBullet source tree.

= Dependencies =

PATH and OSG_FILE_PATH should also be configured as necessary for the OSG, Bullet, and osgWorks dependencies. See their project pages for additional information.
