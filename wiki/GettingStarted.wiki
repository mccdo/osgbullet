= Using osgbpp =

*osgbpp* creates rigid bodies from OSG data and drops them on a platform. Use this application to test rigid body creation with a variety of control parameters.

== Examples ==
Use *osgbpp* to create a rigid body from dice.osg, one of the *osgBullet* data files:

{{{
> osgbpp dice.osg
}}}

To see the model fall again, hit the Delete key. To drag the model, hold down the control key and use the left mouse button.

By default, *osgbpp* creates a Bullet box collision shape. You can visualize the collision shape with the --debug command line option:

{{{
> osgbpp dice.osg --debug
}}}

*osgbpp* supports command line patameters to control the collision shape type. For example:

{{{
> osgbpp dice.osg --debug --cylinder
> osgbpp dice.osg --debug --convexHull
}}}
